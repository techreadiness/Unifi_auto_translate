#### Ranking & Metrics <a href="#ranking-and-metrics" id="ranking-and-metrics"></a>

To maximize your score, you must excel at increasing weekly on-chain active accounts, weekly on-chain transactions, and Mini Dapp revenue.

There are a few points to keep in mind:

* On-Chain Active Accounts:
  * To achieve a higher score on user metrics, we assign greater weight to users who hold more than a certain amount of KAIA tokens (e.g., 1 KAIA). Additionally, they must continuously maintain a minimum KAIA balance (e.g., 1 KAIA) sufficient to cover multiple transaction fees.
  * Users must send at least one transaction to the Mini Dapp’s smart contract during the week.

Given these conditions, builders should focus on the following strategies:

* Distribute KAIA to as many users as possible.
* Ensure that smart contracts, including Mini Dapp’s basic contracts for payments, tokens, and NFTs, are optimized for on-chain activity. It’s advantageous to encourage as many on-chain activities as possible, especially transactions related to asset transfers, such as swaps.

These smart contracts will be tracked based on the smart contract addresses submitted to the Kaia Portal. Therefore, ensure you submit a comprehensive list of contracts via the following link:[ Kaia Portal - Elevating the Web3 Experience](https://portal.kaia.io/dapps/submit). To check if your submitted contracts are properly tracked on the Growth Competition dashboard, please refer to the following link: [https://dune.com/queries/4773070](https://dune.com/queries/4773070)

If you’ve already submitted contracts, you can send the labels and addresses of new smart contracts to portal@kaia.io, and they will be updated within a week.

* Avoiding Over-Focus on On-Chain Transactions:
  * Overemphasizing on-chain transactions is unnecessary, as they carry less weight.
  * Transactions sent directly by Mini Dapp operators will be filtered out.
* Prohibited Activities:
  * Do not engage in fraudulent activities such as bot-generated actions.
  * Data will be monitored in real time. If excessive bot activity is detected, the Mini Dapp will be disqualified from the Growth competition.
* Revenue:
  * Using crypto payments can be advantageous for generating on-chain data, although no extra weight is assigned to crypto payments.
  * To encourage user participation, prioritize stability and make it easy for users to connect their wallets and complete payments.

#### Timeline <a href="#timeline" id="timeline"></a>

To achieve a high score in Phase 2 (March - April) and secure a spot in the Top 10, it’s essential to:

* Attract users with KAIA holdings starting from March 5 (or distribute KAIA via airdrops).
* Drive on-chain activity and generate revenue early to maximize weekly scores.
* The Top 10 Mini DApps will be announced on April 18, based on average weekly scores from March 5 to April 16.
* To participate in the April Growth Competition, Mini DApps must be active for at least three weeks during this period, meaning they must launch no later than March 25.

Among these, two Mini DApps will be selected on April 21 to receive Growth Packages, including $0.5M in marketing support and $0.1M in liquidity support.

#### FAQ <a href="#faq" id="faq"></a>

* What are the weights of each metric?
  * Currently, active accounts and revenue are given higher weights than other metrics.
* Is the ranking overall, or are there separate sector rankings?
  * At this stage, rankings are overall rankings. Sector-specific leaderboards may be introduced in future seasons, such as Kaia Wave Season 2.
* What is the criteria for abuse?
  * Any transaction or account deemed not to be from a real user will be excluded. This includes bot activity or suspicious patterns.
* Are transactions sent by Dapps themselves included?
  * No, only transactions initiated by users are counted.
