{% file src="../../.gitbook/assets/meta sample (1).csv" %}

## 2. Register NFT Collections <a href="#id-2.-register-nft-collections" id="id-2.-register-nft-collections"></a>

The information you've submitted to Ops Support channel, will be registered to Dapp Portal database. This step can be executed by Dapp Portal team on your behalf.

(A Mini Dapp can be assigned to multiple contracts of NFT collections.)

## 3. Deploy contract for NFT Collections assigned Mini Dapp  <a href="#id-3.-deploy-contract-for-nft-collections-assigned-mini-dapp" id="id-3.-deploy-contract-for-nft-collections-assigned-mini-dapp"></a>

Contract for NFT Collections will be deployed by Dapp Portal's server. If the contract is confirmed, we can assign it with Mini Dapp. (It's not about granting permissions of the contract to Mini Dapp, but rather a step to match the unique contract of Mini Dapp within the Dapp Portal.)

## 4. Set Drops <a href="#id-4.-set-drops" id="id-4.-set-drops"></a>

Dapp Portal team will set Drops as information gathered from step 1. When setting up Drops, the NFT minting limit is required. Within this configured Drop, you can add multiple stages to register a detailed sales plan. Please NOTE that the date of sale for the stages cannot overlap.

## 5. Drops

The configured stages within Drops will be displayed in the Market tab in Dapp Portal. Once the specified time for each stage arrives, users can be able to mint the NFTs of yours.

### 5-1. Airdrop stage

A feature that allows a specific wallet in the Dapp to receive NFTs for Airdrop purposes.

For more information of Airdrop stage, Please find [here >](https://docs.dappportal.io/dapp-portal/collection-and-drops/how-to-mint-nft)

### 5-2. Presale Stage

This stage is only available for purchase by pre-registered users(Allowlist). If you want to add an allowlist stage, you can contact the Ops Support channel.

### 5-3. Public Stage

This stage is available for purchase by any user of the Dapp Portal. The public stage must be placed at the very end of all stages in the Drops, and you can add stages until the public stage begins.
