## Note

NPM : [https://www.npmjs.com/package/@linenext/dapp-portal-sdk/v/1.2.11](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@linenext/dapp-portal-sdk/v/1.2.11)&#x20;

The bug has been fixed where requesting `kaia_accounts()` would show the wallet connection screen when there was no connected wallet, and the Client would respond with `[]`.&#x20;

Starting from Mini Dapp SDK v1.2.11, when requesting `kaia_accounts()` with no connected wallet, the Client can get response with `[]` without showing the wallet connection screen.
