#### What's improved

* This version is released to support rebranding of Dapp Portal. (Details regarding the rebranding will be announced via a separate channel soon.)
* Added Methods:
  * Method for querying **USDT Balance**
    * `getErc20TokenBalanceWithDepositedBalance()`&#x20;
  * Signing smart contract for **USDT transfer**
    * For USDT transfers implemented via smart contract including Swap, Developers must include `depositTokenAddress` and `depositAmount` in the `kaia_sendTransaction` request.
    *   Changes are required when the walletType is WEB or LIFF. If the walletType is not a WEB or LIFF, developers should use the AS-IS parameters.

        * for WalletType is not WEB or LIFF (AS-IS)

        ```
        params = {
        type: "SmartContractExecution",
        from: "0x4b53..dbe6",
        to: "contractAddress",
        input: "0xabcd...",
        }
        ```

        * for WalletType is **WEB** or **LIFF**

        ```
        params = {
        type: "SmartContractExecution",
        from: "0x4b53..dbe6",
        to: "contractAddress",
        input: "0xabcd...",
        depositTokenAddress: "0xd077...", // USDT contract address
        depositAmount: "100" // Amount of USDT to transfer
        }
        ```

#### Note

An immediate update to Mini Dapp SDK v1.5.0 is not required. You may choose to update later when the official rebranding announcement is made. _**The added methods will function correctly after the launch of the rebranded Dapp Portal.**_
