# How to mint NFTs and set up Drops.

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
## Submit Information for NFT Collections and Drops <a href="#id-1.-submit-information-for-nft-collections-and-drops" id="id-1.-submit-information-for-nft-collections-and-drops"></a>

If you plan to launch NFT Drops or conduct an NFT Airdrop, you are required to submit the relevant information for your NFT Collections and Drops.

Please complete the Excel template (information/data) located in the BOX folder provided by the Ops team representative. Following completion, upload the accompanying meta file and image files to the same location.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
## Register NFT Collections <a href="#id-2.-register-nft-collections" id="id-2.-register-nft-collections"></a>

The information you've submitted to Ops Support channel, will be registered to Unifi Apps database. This step can be executed by Unifi Apps team on your behalf.

(Apps can be assigned to multiple contracts of NFT collections.)
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
## Deploy contract for NFT Collections assigned Apps <a href="#id-3.-deploy-contract-for-nft-collections-assigned-mini-dapp" id="id-3.-deploy-contract-for-nft-collections-assigned-mini-dapp"></a>

Contract for NFT Collections will be deployed by Unifi App's server. If the contract is confirmed, we can assign it with Apps (It's not about granting permissions of the contract to Apps, but rather a step to match the unique contract of Apps within the Unifi Apps.)
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
## Set Drops <a href="#id-4.-set-drops" id="id-4.-set-drops"></a>

Unifi Apps team will set Drops as information gathered from step 1. When setting up Drops, the NFT minting limit is required. Within this configured Drop, you can add multiple stages to register a detailed sales plan. Please NOTE that the date of sale for the stages cannot overlap.

The configured stages within Drops will be displayed in the Market tab in Unifi Apps. Once the specified time for each stage arrives, users can be able to mint the NFTs of yours
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
## Configurable drops

* ### Airdrop stage
  * A feature that allows a specific wallet in the Apps to receive NFTs for Airdrop purposes. For more information of Airdrop stage, please refer the page 'How to Mint NFT'
* ### Presale Stage
  * This stage is only available for purchase by pre-registered users(Allowlist). If you want to add an allowlist stage, you can contact the Ops Support channel.
* ### Public Stage
  * This stage is available for purchase by any user of the Unfi Apps. The public stage must be placed at the very end of all stages in the Drops, and you can add stages until the public stage begins.
