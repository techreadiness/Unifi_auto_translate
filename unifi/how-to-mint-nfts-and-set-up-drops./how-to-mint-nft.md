**1. NFT Minting for Airdrops (Ops support)**

> The minting of NFTs designated for Airdrops is executed by the Ops Support team.
>
> You should provide the necessary collection information, the wallet addresses for NFT recipients, and the airdrop details (quantity, duration, etc.). The Ops Support team will then mint the NFTs and airdrop them to the provided wallets.

**2. NFT Minting for Marketplace Sales (Unifi Apps)**

> NFTs sold on the Marketplace are minted immediately upon purchase by the Unifi Apps user.
>
> The NFTs are minted to comply with the collection information set before the sales registration. The minting will be processed sequentially according to the order in the `meta.csv` file provided by the Apps team.
