# Growth Competition

## Overview

The Unifi Apps Growth Competition aims to foster rapid user growth, reward top-performing projects, and drive meaningful market traction. Our goal is to identify and support standout Unifi Apps that achieve significant monthly active user (MAU) milestones and notable on-chain token holder counts.

## Competition Summary

The objective is to help Unifi Apps rapidly achieve millions of MAU and on-chain token holders.

* In February and March–April (final timeline to be decided in February 2025), competitions based on key metrics will select the top Unifi Apps for marketing and liquidity support.
* A ranking dashboard will go live in February 7.
* The top 10 Unifi Apps will be selected in Mid February and March-April (final timeline to be decided in February 2025) based on key metrics.
* Among the Top 10, 2 teams will be selected for growth packages based on growth potential evaluations by the foundation and LINE NEXT. They will receive:
  * **up to $0.5M** in marketing support and top exposure on the Unifi
  * **up to $0.1M** in liquidity support
  * Minimum criteria for receiving the growth package may be added later.
* All Unifi Apps developed on the Kaia platform will be subject to mandatory participation. Token airdrops to users at the Token Generation Event (TGE) stage, inclusive of any pre-distributed points, are required.

_\*The exact timeline may change depending on the launch status of the Kaia Wave Unifi Apps._

## Participation Eligibility

## Ranking & Metrics

### Leaderboard Metrics

* Weekly On-chain Active Accounts(High weight): Tracked on-chain. Accounts that hold a minimum amount of KAIA(e.g. at least 1 KAIA) and have submitted at least one transaction to the Unifi Apps contract will receive a higher weight to encourage on-chain asset ownership.
* Weekly On-chain Transactions(Low weight): The number of transactions submitted to the Unifi Apps contract. Transactions from accounts that hold a minimum amount of KAIA(e.g. at least 1 KAIA) and have submitted at least one transaction to the Unifi Apps contract will receive a higher weight to encourage on-chain asset ownership.
* Unifi Apps Revenue(High weight): Revenue activities conducted within the LINE platform (crypto and cash payments), based on LINE’s data.

### Ranking Details
