# Qualifications and Requirements

### Dapp Categories

* Consumer Dapps with user rewards (Dapp points, NFTs and tokens)
* No category restrictions (some DeFi Dapps may require regulatory and compliance check prior to onboarding)
* Dapps deployed in other chains may also apply, however; extra pointers for Kaia-native Dapps

### Dapp Build

* Required to have two versions—(1) LINE and (2) Web versions

### Other Requirements

* Dapps onboarded to the platform are strongly encouraged to issue fungible tokens (FT) on Kaia Chain. If token issuance is not feasible, the Dapp must support in-app item (IAP) sales and select either an IAA or NFT feature. Prior consultation is required if neither IAA nor NFT can be implemented.
* Dapps that issue fungible tokens (FT) are required to allocate a portion of their Dapp or ecosystem tokens under the Kaia Wave onboarding program.
* Dapps must submit their FT launch plans and undergo prior consultation before the Token Generation Event (TGE).
* Only payment and wallet connection methods provided through the Mini Dapp SDK may be used.
* All Dapps must adhere to the compliance standards outlined in our Review Guidelines.
* Additional requirements may apply. Please refer to the Review Guidelines for full details [Review Guidelines | LINE's Mini Dapp Docs](https://docs.dappportal.io/review-guidelines)
