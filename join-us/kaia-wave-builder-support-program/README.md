# Kaia Wave: Builder Support Program

## Kaia Wave Overview

### What is Kaia Wave?

Kaia Wave: Bridging Web2 and Web3&#x20;

Kaia Wave is a builder support program, brought to you by LINE NEXT and the Kaia Foundation - formed by the recent merger of Kakao's Klaytn blockchain and LINE's Finschia blockchain, to onboard new, creative builders on the Kaia ecosystem.

Kaia Wave builders will access more than 200M+ LINE Messenger users who will soon be able to experience everything from wallet creation to using Dapps, trading FTs/ NFTs, referring Dapps to their LINE friends – all within LINE messenger.

We’re looking for builders with a novel idea or service that will be able to harness the attention of LINE users and become a crucial part of their everyday lives, so that we can create something that’s more than a point farm.
