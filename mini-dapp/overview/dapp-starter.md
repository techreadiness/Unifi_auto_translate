# Dapp Starter

When you're new to Dapp development, it can be difficult to know where to begin. In such cases, the **Dapp Starter** can serve as a helpful starting point.

The Dapp Starter is a template that includes the essential features needed for building a Dapp. You can customize and build your own Dapp based on this template.\
This guide walks you through the Dapp Starter in the following steps:

## What is the Dapp Starter?

The **Dapp Starter** is a template project designed to help you easily integrate the `dapp-portal-sdk`. While you can always start your Dapp project from scratch, using this starter allows for a faster and smoother development experience.

It also follows a predefined design guide, which can help maintain consistency in UI/UX.

The project is built with **Next.js**. Even if you're planning to use a different framework, this repository can still serve as a useful reference for integrating the `dapp-portal-sdk`.<br>

## How to get started with the Dapp Starter

### &#x20;Environment

The Dapp Starter requires **Node.js** to run. It uses `pnpm` as the package manager (compatible with `npm`).

* Recommended Node.js version: **>= 20.0.0**
* The version specified in `.nvmrc`: **v20.18.0**
* Older versions may work partially, but for compatibility with Netlify deployment tools, Node.js >= 20.0.0 is required.

\*Tip: Use [`nvm`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage Node versions easily.

### Downloading and running the source code&#x20;

You can clone or fork the repository from GitHub:\
&#x20;[https://github.com/techreadiness/dapp-starter](https://github.com/techreadiness/dapp-starter)

To run the project locally, follow the instructions in the repository’s `README.md`.

### Deploying to a server

Once you’ve run the Dapp Starter locally and verified that it's working, you can deploy it to a live server using **Netlify**:

<details>

<summary>A netlify account is required </summary>

[Netlify (opens new window)](https://www.netlify.com/)is a hosting service for static sites, open an account before deploying to Netlify. The content on this page can be run on Netlify's free plan.

</details>

<details>

<summary>.env.production file should be saved in Netlify setting.</summary>

Go to Project > Project Configuration > Environment Variables and save .env.production variables.&#x20;

</details>

```bash
# Go to the root directory
cd ./
# Build the project
npm build 
# Install netlify cli
npm install -g netlify-cli
# Login Nåetlify and connect repository with your netlify account
netlify login
# Deploy to a draft (preview) environment
netlify deploy
# Once verified, deploy to production
netlify deploy --prod 
```

The official published version is available at [https://dapp-starter.netlify.app](https://dapp-starter.netlify.app).

## Key features of the Dapp starter

The Dapp Starter comes with several basic features implemented out of the box.\
These demonstrate how to use core functionalities from `dapp-portal-sdk`, but should be treated as **reference code**, not a final solution.

### Connect/Disconnect wallet

Connecting and disconnecting a wallet is the most fundamental feature when using the SDK.\
In the code, you’ll find how to use `walletProvider` and its methods.<br>

**reference code**\

### Wallet Session Persistence

You can first check whether a login session exists by calling\
`walletProvider.request({ method: 'kaia_accounts' })`, so that the wallet session remains active after a user logs in once for convenience.<br>

**reference code**\

### Crypto/Fiat payment

The template shows how to handle both **crypto** and **fiat** payments using `paymentProvider`.

You can see examples of:

* Creating paymentId
* Checking the payment status
* Finalizing the payment<br>

**reference code**

[functions related to payment](https://github.com/techreadiness/dapp-starter/blob/cf5227243e2d878effdc634cd83f27b75b5b65e5/src/components/Store/Sdk/paymentSdk.hooks.ts#L39)

### KAIA/STRIPE ratio

To support payments, your Dapp needs to apply proper price conversion logic between **crypto (KAIA)** and **fiat (STRIPE)**.\
The starter includes a `usd-to-kaia` function as a reference.<br>

**reference code**\

### KAIA/USDT balance

The template shows how to get balance of both kaia and erc20 based token.\

### LIFF integration

If you're planning to integrate with **LINE Front-end Framework (LIFF)**, this project includes useful examples such as:

* When to initialize LIFF
* How to use methods like `shareTargetPicker`\
  <br>
