# Overview

## Key Features

Mini Dapp is a web application developed based on the LINE messenger and Kaia Blockchain. It leverages the LINE user pool to provide diverse experiences and rewards to about 200 million global users. Unlike LINE MINI Apps, Mini Dapp can offer not only points and cash-like rewards but also Web 3-based rewards. Additionally, Mini Dapps can provide the same services to users who are not LINE users. Using LINE Messenger's Official Account for promotions and friend invites can help gather more LINE-based users.

Also, Mini Dapp should provide various functions including Play, Wallet, Payment and Reward.  See the key features below.

## Service Environment

Mini Dapps need to create web applications utilizing a specific framework.LIFF version for users who access via LINE Messenger and web version for users who access via Non-LINE Messenger.

* **Mini Dapps must be built as two versions to cover broader regions.**
  * The reason for developing the Mini Dapp in both LIFF and Web versions are as follows: In certain countries, it may be difficult or impossible to use LINE Messanger. Additionally, Web3 users may prefer not to use LINE version. \
    Therefore, we request the separate development of a web version for these countries and Web3 users.
  * Mini Dapp - LIFF is the version that runs the application within LINE Messenger\
    (for LINE users).
  * Mini Dapp - Web is the version that runs the application on the web browser\
    (for non-LINE users).
