## Set OpenGraph

The LIFF/Web URL of the Dapp can be utilized across various marketing channels. If Open Graph is not set up, it may reduce the effectiveness of content delivery. Therefore, please ensure that Open Graph is properly configured. Without it, blank spaces or alternative text may appear where the link is displayed.

## Connect Button design

If Wallet Connect is integrated when initiating specific actions (such as Buy, NFT Airdrop, FT Airdrop, etc.) rather than using a standard button, please ensure that Wallet Connect is triggered when those actions are executed. It is acceptable for Wallet Connect not to be initiated based on the button guidelines provided. However, if you create a button similar to Wallet Connect, please make sure to adhere to the aforementioned guidelines.
