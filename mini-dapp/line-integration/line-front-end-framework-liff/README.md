### Web app connecting with LINE users

The LINE Front-end Framework (LIFF) is a web application framework provided by LY Corporation. When you integrate the LIFF SDK into your web app, you will be able to access information provided by the LINE Platform or use functionalities provided by the LINE app.

### Integration with LINE Login and the LINE Platform

LIFF is integrated with LINE Login. Without having to deal with complicated settings, you can safely access a user's profile information via the LINE Platform's authorization flow.

The share target picker is a tool for sending messages to LINE friends who you can select via LIFF app. Even without opening a chat room the developer can send messages to LINE friends, so you can use this feature to connect users with services, send information, and add social elements.

## Cross-browser support
