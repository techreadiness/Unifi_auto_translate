The Mini Dapp SDK provides Bitget Wallet via WalletConnect. To offer Bitget Wallet through the Mini Dapp SDK, the domain verification required by WalletConnect must be completed beforehand.&#x20;

Please follow the guide below to complete the domain verification and share the `ProjectId` generated by Reown with the Dapp Portal team.

:exclamation:<mark style="color:red;">**Even if you upgrade to the SDK version that supports Bitget integration, you will not be able to use Bitget Wallet unless the domain registration and ProjectId submission are completed.**</mark>
