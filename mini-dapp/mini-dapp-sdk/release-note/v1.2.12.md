# v1.2.12

## Release Date

April 23rd 2025 07:30 in UTC

## Note

**We strongly recommend upgrading to this version of the Mini Dapp SDK.**

npm: [https://www.npmjs.com/package/@linenext/dapp-portal-sdk/v/1.2.12](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@linenext/dapp-portal-sdk/v/1.2.12)&#x20;

cdn: [https://static.kaiawallet.io/js/dapp-portal-sdk-1.2.12.js](https://static.kaiawallet.io/js/dapp-portal-sdk-1.2.12.js)

#### Point#1

Fixed issue where the Mini Dapp SDK failed to detect account changes in the OKX Wallet

\[Before v1.2.12]

When the user changes the account in the Extension while the OKX Wallet is connected,

* SDK returns former account when request `kaia_accounts()` or `kaia_requestAccounts()`&#x20;
* User cannot sign because the connected wallet is different from the wallet address in the signature data

\[After v1.2.12]

When the user changes the account in the Extension while the OKX Wallet is connected,

* SDK returns latter account when request `kaia_accounts()` or `kaia_requestAccounts()`&#x20;
* User can sign

#### Point#2 \[Action Requried]

Fixed issue whre OKX Wallet is not properly disconnected when requested `walletProvider.disconnectWallet()`

\[Before v1.2.12]

Since there is no way to await for `walletProvider.disconnectWallet()` to complete, refreshing immediately after requesting `disconnectWallet()` results in the OKX Wallet connection not being properly disconnected.

\[After v1.2.12]

Changed `walletProvider.disconnectWallet()` as async function

```
// ASIS
walletProvider.disconnectWallet();
window.location.reload(); // <- Failed to disconnect OKX Wallet

// TOBE
await walletProvider.disconnectWallet();
window.location.reload(); // <- Success to disconnect OKX Wallet
```

#### Point#3 \[Action Requried]

Fixed error when requested `walletProvider.disconnectWallet()`

\[ASIS]

After requesting `walletProvider.disconnectWallet()`, the page must be refreshed or the walletProvider needs to be reassigned to a variable in order to be able to select the wallet type again.

\[TOBE]

After requesting `walletProvider.disconnectWallet()`, without any additional implementation, it is possible to select the wallet type again when making a subsequent `walletProvider.request({method: "kaia_requestAccounts"})` request.
