# v1.4.6

## Release Date

Oct 15th 2025 06:00 in UTC

## Note

* npm: [https://www.npmjs.com/package/@linenext/dapp-portal-sdk/v/1.4.6](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@linenext/dapp-portal-sdk/v/1.4.6)
* cdn: [https://static.kaiawallet.io/js/dapp-portal-sdk-1.4.6.js](https://static.kaiawallet.io/js/dapp-portal-sdk-1.4.6.js)

#### What's improved

* We added a safeguard that rejects payment requests when the connected wallet's chainId does not match the payment environment (mainnet/testnet).
  * **Testnet:** `chainId: 1001`, `testMode: true`
  * **Mainnet:** `chainId: 8217`, `testMode: false`
  * Any other combinations will result in a payment error.
  * When a payment error occurs, the SDK automatically detects the issue and throws an exception to the developer’s code.\
    The following messages may appear in the log:
    * `The payment is set to test mode, but DappPortalSDK is initialized with mainnet (8217).`
    * `The payment is set to non-test mode, but DappPortalSDK is initialized with testnet (1001).`
