## Release Date

## Note

[https://www.npmjs.com/package/@linenext/dapp-portal-sdk/v/1.2.5](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@linenext/dapp-portal-sdk/v/1.2.5)

* Changed the `408 error` that occurs during long polling timeout to response as `202`.
* Enhanced it to explicitly trigger an error when requesting `kaia_signLegacy` with the OKX wallet.
  * (Optional) To receive the changed responses, you need to update the SDK version to v1.2.5.
* Resumed testMode: true.
  * An SDK version upgrade is not necessary. You just can use the test environment by setting the testMode as 'true' when requesting the payment create API.
