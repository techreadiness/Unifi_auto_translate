# v1.2.1

## Release Date

**January 21st, 2025 06:00 in UTC**

## Backend

[https://www.npmjs.com/package/@linenext/dapp-portal-sdk/v/1.2.1](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@linenext/dapp-portal-sdk/v/1.2.1)

1. Fixed intermittent iOS Wallet Connection (LIFF) failures and Mini Dapp crashes when attempting Wallet Connect.
2. For STRIPE and CRYPTO payments in a CONFIRMED state where the payment finalize API has not been called, automatically change the status to FINALIZED within 5 minutes (improvement for normal settlement).

* To prevent issue #1, we strongly recommend upgrading the SDK to version 1.2.1. \
  (No additional code changes are required.)
* Issue #2 is outside the scope of developer responsibility.
