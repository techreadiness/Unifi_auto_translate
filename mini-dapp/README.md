You can check the development scope required for implementing Mini Dapps in the diagram above.

LIFF version of the Mini Dapp must be implemented through LINE Developers. More details can be found in the LINE Integration menu.

The Mini Dapp SDK supports wallet integration and payment functionality. The wallet that connects may vary depending on the LIFF and web versions. Mini Dapps can sell in-app items through the payment feature.

Additionally, if you register your information through a separate track, you may be featured on the Dapp Portal and also sell NFTs.
